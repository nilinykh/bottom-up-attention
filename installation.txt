These are the steps I took to install caffe from Anderson's FasterRCNN for my feature extraction.

1. Use brew (linux version) to install all dependencies, the tutorial I followed: http://zyxue.github.io/2015/05/12/install-caffe-on-linux-host-without-root-permission.html
2. Important note about OpenCV files: https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/6680
   OpenCV: different syntax for version2 and version3
3. To check paths: https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/3597 
4. to let it find the necessary python config file, set up the environmental variable: https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/410
5. do not forget to 'brew install boost-python3' (boost-python is not compiled for ubuntu, only for mac) and set the symlink if the lib file is not found:
https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/6063
6. A good piece of information: https://gist.github.com/kylemcdonald/0698c7749e483cd43a0e
7. Make sure your numpy is correctly specified: https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/5432
8. when can't import _caffe module: https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/263
9. and important note about importing caffe in ipython vs python scripts: https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/3597
10. Makefile is prepared now! Check the paths in it.

Important: brew paths (opencv package, in particular) could be moved one directory up
Brew installs everything in /home/xilini/.linuxbrew, just to know.
